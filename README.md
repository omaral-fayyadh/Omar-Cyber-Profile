<p>
  I’m a cybersecurity professional with a background in telecom engineering, a passion for cloud security, and a love for languages. I hold a Master’s in Information Assurance & Cybersecurity (4.0 GPA) and actively pursue certifications like CCSK, AZ-900, and AZ-500. Whether deploying honeypots, analyzing security events, or participating in CTF challenges, I’m committed to hands-on learning and continuous growth.

  <h2>👨‍💻 Cybersecurity Projects</h2>
  <ul>

<li>
    <strong>Building a Cowrie Honeypot with Splunk SIEM Integration</strong><br/>
    Developed a <strong>Cowrie SSH/Telnet honeypot</strong> on a Linux server hosted in <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong> to capture and analyze brute-force and credential-based attacks.  
    Configured <strong>Splunk Universal Forwarder</strong> to collect Cowrie logs and visualize attacker behavior in a custom-built dashboard.<br/>
    The dashboard tracks <em>top attacker IPs, commands executed, login attempts, and session durations</em> — offering actionable insights into malicious activity patterns.<br/>

  <li>
    <strong>Deploying a T-Pot Honeypot on Microsoft Azure</strong><br/>
    Deployed the open-source <a href="https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce" target="_blank">T-Pot honeypot framework</a> in a cloud environment to simulate real-world attack surfaces.  
    This project enabled the collection and analysis of threat intelligence by capturing live attacker traffic across multiple honeypot sensors.<br/>
