<h2>🛡️ Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge (CCSK)</h2>
<p>
    I pursued the <strong>CCSK</strong> to solidify my expertise in cloud security principles, including data protection, identity management, and risk assessment across cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS). This certification deepened my understanding of the <em>shared responsibility model</em> and security best practices outlined by the <strong>Cloud Security Alliance</strong>, including the <strong>Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)</strong> and <strong>ENISA</strong> guidelines.
